  One of the most noticible features of B-series PCB is the ability to freely change the color of RGB LED.



  Additionally you can set the keyboard functions as you wish by using “bootMapper Client” program for PC.





  New firmware “ps2avrGB” is the upgraded version of ps2avrU with the power to control RGB LED.





  And also you can customize and order the acrylic case easily.
